# AI Usage Declaration

AI tools were used in this project as learning and development assistance, in accordance with the course guidelines.

## Tools Used
- ChatGPT (OpenAI)
- Copilot 

## How AI Tools Were Used

AI tools were used to support the project in the following ways:

- Clarifying concepts related to machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) and evaluation metrics.
- Assisting with debugging Python errors (e.g. indentation issues, import errors).
- Helping structure the project according to best practices (project architecture, modular code).
- Providing guidance on data preprocessing steps (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables).
- Suggesting ways to visualize results (confusion matrices, feature importance plots, sector-level comparisons).

## Author Contribution

All code was written, reviewed, and adapted by the author.  
The author understands the implemented methods, models, and evaluation procedures, and made all final decisions regarding project design and implementation.

AI tools were not used to automatically generate the full project, but rather as an educational aid throughout the development process.

## Compliance Statement

The use of AI tools in this project complies with the course policy on AI-assisted work.  
This project represents the author’s own work and understanding.
